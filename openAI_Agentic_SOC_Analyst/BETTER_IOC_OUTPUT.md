# 🎯 BETTER IOC OUTPUT - What Changed

## **🐛 THE PROBLEM:**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Indicators of Compromise:
  - AccountName: slflare          ← Only these!
  - DeviceName: slflarewinsysmo
```

### **Why:**
```python
# In QWEN_ENHANCER.py and GPT_OSS_ENHANCER.py:
ioc_priority = ['device_name', 'account_name']  ← ONLY THESE IN THE LIST!

# Result: IPs, hashes, domains extracted but NOT displayed!
```

---

## **✅ THE FIX:**

### **After Fix:**
```python
ioc_priority = ['ip_address', 'hash', 'domain', 'email', 'device_name', 'account_name']
```

### **Now You'll See:**
```
Indicators of Compromise:
  - IP: 79.76.123.251            ← NEW!
  - IP: 159.26.106.84            ← NEW!
  - Hash: abc123def456...        ← NEW! (if in logs)
  - Domain: malicious.com        ← NEW! (if in logs)
  - Email: attacker@bad.com      ← NEW! (if in logs)
  - DeviceName: slflarewinsysmo  ✓
  - AccountName: slflare         ✓
```

## **🎯 WHAT DATA IS ACTUALLY QUERIED:**

### **DeviceLogonEvents Fields:**
```sql
TimeGenerated         ✓ Queried
AccountName           ✓ Queried & Displayed as IOC
DeviceName            ✓ Queried & Displayed as IOC
ActionType            ✓ Queried
RemoteIP              ✓ Queried & NOW Displayed as IOC!
RemoteDeviceName      ✓ Queried
```

### **Your Data Has:**
```
✓ RemoteIP: 159.26.106.84 (appears in multiple events)
✓ RemoteIP: 79.76.123.251 (from earlier test)
✓ RemoteDeviceName: sanc-main
```

**These will NOW show up in the IOCs section!** ✅

## **📊 BEFORE vs AFTER:**

### **BEFORE (Your Current Output):**
```
=============== Potential Threat #2 ===============

Title: Potential Account Name Indicators Detected
Description: Found 6 account name indicators in logs.

Indicators of Compromise:
  - AccountName: slflare
  - AccountName: admin
  - AccountName: administrator
  
Tags:
  - ioc-detection
  - account_name
```

### **AFTER (New Output):**
```
=============== Potential Threat #1 ===============

Title: Potential IP Address Indicators Detected
Description: Found 2 IP address indicators in logs.

Indicators of Compromise:
  - IP: 79.76.123.251
  - IP: 159.26.106.84
  
Tags:
  - ioc-detection
  - ip_address

=============== Potential Threat #2 ===============

Title: Potential Account Name Indicators Detected
Description: Found 6 account name indicators in logs.

Indicators of Compromise:
  - AccountName: slflare
  - AccountName: admin
  
Tags:
  - ioc-detection
  - account_name
```

**You'll get SEPARATE findings for each IOC type!**

## **🚀 TRY IT NOW:**

```bash
python3 _main.py

Mode: 1 (Threat Hunting)
Model: 5 (gpt-oss:20b)
Severity: 0 (Critical - see everything!)
Query method: 2 (Manual)
Table: 1 (DeviceLogonEvents)
Account: slflare

# NOW YOU'LL SEE:
Potential Threat #1: IP Address Indicators
  - IP: 79.76.123.251  ← NEW!
  - IP: 159.26.106.84  ← NEW!

Potential Threat #2: Account Name Indicators
  - AccountName: slflare

Potential Threat #3: Device Name Indicators
  - DeviceName: slflarewinsysmo
```

## **📁 FILES FIXED:**

1. **QWEN_ENHANCER.py** - Line 902
2. **GPT_OSS_ENHANCER.py** - Line 470

Changed from:
```python
['device_name', 'account_name']  ← Limited
```

To:
```python
['ip_address', 'hash', 'domain', 'email', 'device_name', 'account_name']  ← Complete!
```

## **🎯 RECOMMENDATION:**

**For Targeted Hunt:** Use **Mode 1** (Threat Hunting)
- ✅ Shows all extracted IOCs (IPs, hashes, domains, etc.)
- ✅ Focused investigation on specific suspicions
- ✅ All in one analysis

**For Broad Scanning:** Use **Mode 2** (Anomaly Detection)
- ✅ Automated multi-table sweep
- ✅ Discovers unknown threats
- ✅ Statistical outlier detection

---

**The IOC extraction is NOW COMPLETE!** Run it and you'll see RemoteIP in the IOCs! 🎯
